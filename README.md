- **Playlists**: Browse and explore various playlists.
- **Genre-Based Songs**: Discover songs categorized under different genres.
- **Music Player**: Play, pause, like, and dislike songs using the built-in music player.
- **Dummy Data**: The app uses dummy data for demonstration purposes, imported from a data folder.
